The site has been working for years and is supposed to be working for many more. Getting rid of the Flash technology made it possible to recreate the site completely responsive on mobile devices.<br/><br/>I also wrote a CMS in PHP for easy input of new student projects and management of the old ones.<br/><br/>The website address: <a href='http://buszmeni.pl/'>buszmeni.pl</a>",
